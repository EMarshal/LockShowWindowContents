#### LockShowWindowContents

WPF application for enabling the Windows option "Show window contents while dragging" and keeping it enabled.

Developed to work around bug in Citrix client which periodically disables "Show window contents while dragging" option on client system.

Inspired by: https://gist.github.com/neokril/8035995

Functionality: If not already enabled, app enables "Show window contents while dragging" on launch, and any time the setting changes. No UI other than system tray icon which can be used to close app.
